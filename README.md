# Attendance-Assistant-
WebD project to take attendance easily online.

Brief: This Project is a prototype of Student Attendance Calculator which basically marks the student's attendance in an institution just by entering the correct code given by the Teacher. This helps in effectively reducing the amount of Time taken and the 'Proxy' methods resulting an efficient and almost accurate attendance.
